# The-Quest-For-The-Golden-Whatever

A random ASCII Roguelike I'm programming out of boredom.

This Roguelike uses TCODLIBPY, and follows the roguelike tutorial @ https://rogueliketutorials.com/tutorials/tcod/v2

feel free to mod. idc

Currently in progress right now, but releases will start when I finish the tutorial.

  - Added Ice Debuff
  - Added 2 new enemies (Troll Commander Boss, Ice Fiend)
  - Added 2 new items (Ice Sword and Ice Armor)
  - Added Boss Arenas that generate every 3rd floor.
